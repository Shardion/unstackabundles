# Unstackabundles

A Fabric mod that allows bundles to contain 4 unstackable items instead of just 1, surely solving the inventory problem for years to come.

(Craftable bundles sold separately.)

## Technical details

This mod is just one mixin, which means it technically doesn't need Fabric API, but you'll probably want it anyways.
